abstract: The “pro-life” movement has sought to end the practice of abortion in the United States for the past 50 years. Crisis Pregnancy Centers (CPCs) are an integral part of this effort, and provide counseling services from an anti-abortion perspective. I study the location choice of CPCs and the impact of CPCs on fertility outcomes. CPCs lower the local abortion rate by 9.6 percent, with larger effects among teenagers and young women. I also show that the presence of CPCs leads to an increase in birth rates.
