abstract: For the past 50 years, the “pro-life” movement has sought to end the practice of
abortion in the United States. Crisis pregnancy centers (CPCs) are an integral part of
this effort and provide counseling services from an anti-abortion perspective. I study
the location choice of CPCs and their impact on fertility outcomes. CPCs lower the
local abortion rate by 10.0 percent, with larger effects observed among teenagers and
young women. I also show that the presence of CPCs leads to an increase in birth rates.
